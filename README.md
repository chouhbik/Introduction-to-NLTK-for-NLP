Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes from an automatic or semi-automatic process of human language. The NLP was developed around linguistic research and cognitive science, psychology, biology and mathematics. In the particular field of computer science, NLP is related to compilation techniques, formal language theory, human-machine interaction and "machine learning".

There is a learning manual for this set titled Natural Language Processing with Python ( in English):
